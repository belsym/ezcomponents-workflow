ezcomponents-workflow
=====================

Mirrors the development trunk of the Workflow component from ezComponents

ezComponents' Workflow
----------------------

This is a port of the svn development branch of the [Workflow Component](http://ezcomponents.org/docs/tutorials) from ezComponents].

I have ported this to git as I wanted to use it within a Symfony based project and there didn't seem to be any way to manage this easily through git already.

If it is of any use to you, enjoy.
